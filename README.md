# Verwaltungssystem

Welcome to the Verwaltungssystem project! This is my first project in Java, developed to learn and apply Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.

## Overview

The Verwaltungssystem (Management System) is designed to manage and organize various entities, providing a practical application to practice Java programming and OOP concepts.

## Features

- **Entity Management**: Create, read, update, and delete operations for different entities.
- **User Interaction**: Console-based interface for user input and interaction.
- **Data Storage**: In-memory storage of entities with potential for future database integration.

## Learning Objectives

This project aims to achieve the following educational goals:

1. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Apply OOP principles such as classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.
2. **Java Syntax and Concepts**: Gain proficiency in Java syntax, data types, control structures, and standard libraries.
3. **Problem-Solving Skills**: Develop logical thinking by translating real-world scenarios into programmable solutions.
4. **Version Control Practices**: Use Git for version control to manage and track changes throughout the development process.
5. **Code Readability and Maintainability**: Write clean, well-documented code to ensure future modifications and enhancements are easily manageable.

## Getting Started

To run the project locally:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MainDeSang/Verwaltungssystem.git

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd Verwaltungssystem

3. **Compile and Run**:
  If using an IDE, open the project and run the main class.
  If using the command line, compile the source files and execute the main class.
